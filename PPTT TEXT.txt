Problem Statement

Design a Java console-based program to manage books in a library. The system should allow

adding books, borrowing books, and displaying available and borrowed books using Java

Collections.



Mandatory Requirements

1. Data Storage

You must use the following collections:

• HashMap<Integer, String>

→ Store Book ID as Key and Book Name as Value

• ArrayList<Integer>

→ Store Book IDs of borrowed books



2. Functional Requirements

Your program should support the following operations:

a) Add New Books

• Allow the user to add a new book by entering:

o Book ID

o Book Name

• Store the book in the HashM

• Prevent duplicate Book IDs

b) Borrow a Book

• Allow the user to borrow a book using its Book ID

• Check if the book exists in the library

• Ensure the book is not already borrowed

• Add the Book ID to the borrowed books list

c) Display Available Books

• Display all books that are:

o Present in the library

o Not currently borrowed

• Show both Book ID and Book Name

d) Display Borrowed Books

• Display all borrowed books

• Show Book ID and corresponding Book Name



Program Flow (Suggested)

1. Display a menu with options:

o Add Book

o Borrow Book

o View Available Books

o View Borrowed Books

o Exit

2. Allow the user to choose an option

3. Perform the selected operation

4. Repeat until the user exits

Constraints & Guidelines

• Use only Java Collections (no arrays for main storage)

• Write clean, readable, and well-commented code

• Use meaningful variable and method names

• Handle invalid inputs gracefully



Submission Guidelines

• Submit the program as .java file(s)

• Ensure the program runs without errors

• Include comments explaining logic

• Folder name: LibraryManagementSystem
